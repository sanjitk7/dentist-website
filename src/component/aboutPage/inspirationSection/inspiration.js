                Dr Patil and his hospital have many firsts to their credit. The state of art Digital Dentistry Complete Ceramic Reconstruction (CEREC) CADCAM System, which has revolutionised the cosmic dental treatment procedures was first established in entire South India in Kalaburagi. Shwetha Dentistry was the 13th hospital in the entire country to have this facility. <br/><br/> This innovative facility has enabled the hospital to introduce an altogether new concept of “One Visit Dentistry” using the CEREC system. The teeth which require the crown after the Root Canal Treatment and filling is digitally scanned for a digital impression of the teeth. The impression is transferred to the robotic milling machine which designs the crown from the pre-fixed Lithium Disilicate material imported from Germany to the size required within 15 minutes. After following a few technical procedures, like hardening the designed crown to the required level, the crown is placed in the mouth of the patient within three hours on the same day. <br/><br/> Shwetha Dentistry is the first to include the most modern Microscope-assisted Root Canal Treatment facility which helps in bringing down the loss of tooth material to zero during the root canal treatment and also accurately treat the affected root. <br/><br/> The Hospital offers nine specialised treatments for dental ailments including Orthodontics, Endodontic, Oral Surgery, Periodontics, Dental Implants, Implantology, Prosthodontics, Laser Gum Treatment, Oral Medicine, and Oral Radiology. <br/><br/> Besides all these specialisations offered in the hospital, one of the rare specialisations offered is Lingual Orthodontics. Shwetha Dentistry is the exclusive hospital to offer the lingual orthodontics specialisation in the entire North Karnataka. Dr Patil has a rich experience of nearly a decade in offering specialised lingual orthodontics (invisible) treatment. <br/><br/> The patients suffering from irregular teeth alignment are offered permanent treatment solutions through Invisalign treatment using the latest kind of invisible braces. Shwetha Dentistry is an exclusive Invisalign provider for the entire North Karnataka. <br/><br/> The hospital also provides laser dental surgeries which are painless and bloodless surgeries are also provided for different gum diseases and the healing process was faster in the patients who undergo laser-based dental surgeries. The hospital also offers instant teeth whitening in one single sitting using the imported Zoom Teeth whitening technology. Advanced 3D radiology facility is also available in the hospital.
